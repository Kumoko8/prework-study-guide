# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description


- This project was created to practice the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitHub while at the same time giving a framework for new students to take notes. This helps students overcome the information overload syndrome. I learned a lot about each type of language and how important practice and repetition and collaboration will be!
